	<h3>&nbspHow do you get to the CNE?</h3>

	<p id = "CNEHow">
		If you are driving to the CNE, input the address of the CNE mentioned above to a GPS. However if you are using public transit, there are two ways of commuting. TTC is the cheapest but longest way of going to the CNE. If you are using the TTC, it would be recommended to take the train down to Dufferin station and take a bus straight down to the Exhibition Place. However if you are using the GO (which is the expensive and comfortable way), pay for an all day pass and just go straight to the Exhibition Place GO station.
