		for being the tallest freestanding structure in the world. Its distict features, from the Y-shaped foundation, to the iconic antenna that powers many radio stations across Toronto. It has never been sought after to be the most important tourist attraction in Toronto. For more information about the CN Tower's ticket price, click <a href="tickets.html"> here</a>.

		This tourist attraction is quite different, as it is an annual festival located in the GTA (Greater Toronto Area). The CNE, a.k.a The Canadian National Exhibition, is the largest exhibtion in Canada. This festival started of in the early 1900s and the cultural vibes still shine bright to this day. Although, this takes place only in the last two weeks of August, so plan accordingly when visiting to Toronto, if CNE is your top priority. The CNE is known to have its National Air Show, with jets and old planes soaring through the skies. Also, there are many food vendors that are very diverse, from the infamous collosal onion to freshly squeezed lemonade, the CNE is filled with fun and entertainment that will keep you satisfied for the whole day!

		 Tourists are most likely to go shopping, no matter where they are! The number one place to shop is the Eaton Centre. This shopping centre is one of the largest malls in Canada, of up to 235 operating stores! This mall has many stores to look at, that it may take the whole day just to visit! It is located right in the centre of downtown, right on Young and Dundas. This intersection is the most lively place in Toronto. Lots of screens and entertainment lighting up the whole night, with many people enjoying the view. This place is similar to the Time Square in New York City but much less crowded :).
